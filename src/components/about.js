      <h2>About</h2>
<p className="about_text">      Having worked in IT Training and Support roles for many years I was made redundant in April 2020 and with the job market stagnated due the lockdown I turned to coding to pass the time. Coding had been a hobby for many years and I had been lucky enough to be able to incorporate in most of my roles until then. Like many during the lockdowns I began considering the shape of my future life and I decided to do more of the things I loved. Coding being one of these things. I applied and was accepted on the 16 week intensive Code Clan Software Development where I learned Python, React and Jave course. Soo after finishing the course I began working as a Junior Software Developer using JavaScript and SQL.</p>
    <p className="about_text">  Outside work I am continuing to learn new coding skills and I am pursuing my other love which is history. I spend my free time visiting and researching aspects of Scottish and British History and intend to start documenting this on a new blog soon.</p>
