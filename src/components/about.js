      <h2>About</h2>
<p className="about_text">      Having worked in IT Training and Support roles for may years I was made redundant in April 2020 and with the job market stagnated due the lockdown I turned to coding to pass the time. Coding was a hobby of many years which I had been lucky enough to be able to incorporate in most of my roles until then. Like many I began considering the shape of my future life during the lockdown and I decided to do more of the things I loved. Coding being one of these things. I applied and was accepted on the 16 week intensive Code Clan Software Development course and now work as a Junior Software Developer using JavaScript and SQL.</p>
    <p className="about_text">  Outside work I am continuing to learn new coding skills particularily React and am pursuing my other love which is history. I spend my free time visiting and researching aspects of Scottish and British History and intend to start documenting this on a new blog.</p>
